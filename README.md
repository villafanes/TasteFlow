TasteFlow is a program designed to allow the user to see the statistics of their entire Spotify listening history. In other words, the user can see the flow of how their taste in music has evolved.


The user must request the files directly from Spotify, and upload them to the program in order to use TasteFlow. Here is more information on how to do so:
