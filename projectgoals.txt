Objectives:
- read through JSON file to extract the date, song name, artist name, and album name from each streaming instance
    - store these in a dictionary with key-value pairs
- group streaming instances by artist
- within artist groupings, group by album
   User Functions:
- see number of times they've streamed an artist ever and by year *
- see number of times they've streamed an album ever and by year *
- see number of times they've streamed a song ever and by year *
- see their artists in order of most-least listened to ever and by year
- see their ranking of albums (by artist) in order of most-least listened to
- see their ranking of songs on each album in order of most-least listened to
    - achieved by grouping song streams by album

    TBD:
- Table/Spreadsheet/Dashboard design?
